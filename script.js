// Document Object Model.
// Tree of nodes / elements created by browser.
// Javascript can be used to read / write / manipulate to the DOM.
// Object Oriented Representation.

/** These are the building blocks of the language and they are critical but now we're going to get to actually use this stuff in 
 * combination with the browser with with the DOM. All right. So what is the DOM? It stands for the document object model 
 * and it's basically a structured representation of an HTML document. It can be thought of kind of as a tree of nodes or elements 
 * created by the browser. Okay, and when I say node or element, I mean in any of the HTML tags the HTML tag, the body tag, 
 * each one's pretty much anything that is in the document and we can use JavaScript to manipulate these DOM elements or nodes. 
 * The DOM is object oriented, meaning that each node has its own set of properties and methods that we can change, we can add, 
 * we can remove. Now the browser gives us a window object and inside that we have a document object.*/
